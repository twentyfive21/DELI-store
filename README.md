# Interesting piece of code :

## I found this piece of code interesting because when I was writing my code I realized that I would have to repeat the exact same thing for alot of the ingredients. I knew that would violate the DRY code principle and knew I could make this a utility method to make my code cleaner. I love this implementation because it saved me so many lines of code I can't even imagine having to write that could not be used throughout the applciation. As a coder I strive to try to write things once and use throughtout the program if possible.
